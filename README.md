# ibtihelart — Personal Art Portfolio

This project is one of my earliest personal websites. It is a fully hand-coded portfolio built to present my artwork in different categories (Food Painting, Florals, Abstract Landscape, and Cityscape). The goal of this project was to practice clean HTML/CSS structure, layout composition, and content organization.

## Features
- Hero section with introductory message
- About section highlighting artistic process
- Categorized gallery layout for paintings
- Contact form with simple HTML validation
- Clean layout system built without frameworks
- Early experimentation with white space, grids, and manual UI composition

## Tech Stack

- CSS3 (custom responsive layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript (minimal)
